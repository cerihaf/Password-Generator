# Password Generator

Password Generator generates a randomly generated password based on the criteria you choose.

## Description

When you click the Generate Password button on the page, a window prompt will pull down and ask what criteria you want included in your randomly generated password. You can choose from Length and Characters. You must choose one of the two options. If you only choose one option, the website will automatically randomly generate a password with what ever criteria you gave it and if you didn't give it criteria for one of the options, it will do it for you. 

If you generate a password and then click the button and go through the options, it will erase the last generate password and replace it with your new password.
